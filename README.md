1. School Feeding Program Analysis
The government of Uganda implemented a school feeding program aimed at improving primary school attendance by providing free meals. This analysis assesses the program's impact on student attendance, focusing on the following steps:

Data Cleaning and Merging: Combined school attendance data with district names and computed total enrollments.
School Ranking: Assigned school IDs based on enrollment numbers to facilitate ranking.
Outlier Detection: Checked for anomalies in numeric variables and addressed them.
Regression Analysis: Conducted fixed-effects regression models to assess the impact of the feeding program on school attendance.
Visualization: Created graphs comparing female attendance rates between treatment (schools with feeding programs) and control groups.
Key Findings:
Schools with feeding programs show higher female attendance rates than control schools.
Controlling for the total number of enrollees reduces the difference, indicating that school size partially explains the attendance rates.
2. Health Insurance Uptake Analysis
This dataset explores factors influencing health insurance uptake in an African country using data from a 2010 medical expenditure survey. The analysis covers the following aspects:

Data Cleaning: Processed and cleaned data, including handling anomalies and missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Investigated the distribution of respondents by gender and age.
Relationship Testing: Analyzed the association between health status and insurance coverage using chi-square tests.# STATA_HEALTH-SCHOOL-ANALYSIS
